# Walkability Analysis

## Background Information

Food equity is a leading social justice issue in the twenty-first century.
Boston, Massachusetts has dedicated resources to addressing food insecurity and
equitable access in recent years (Anderson 2023). Part of equitable access to
food is walkability to locations such as food pantries. Walkability measurements
vary based on the model being applied, though all include some measure of the
distance of households from a resource, the number of intersections between a
household and the resource, and population density (Perez-Pereda et al 2024,
Anderson 2023). Walkability can be improved by ensuring that resources are
distributed at appropriate intervals throughout an area and by providing
amenities such as sidewalks to improve walking accessibility. Additional means
of improving walkability can include decreasing speed limits of pedestrian roads
(Anderson 2023). The study focuses on analyzing the walkability of food
distribution sites across five Massachusetts cities: Danvers, Beverly, Peabody,
Lynn, and Salem. This North Shore region represents a diverse population with
varying socioeconomic backgrounds, making it an ideal area to explore the
challenges and equity issues surrounding food accessibility. The study timeframe
spans from 202x to 2024, capturing recent changes in food distribution networks,
community demographics, and environmental factors like increased flood risks or
new transit developments that could impact walkability. The primary population
of interest includes residents across these five cities, many of whom rely on
food pantries and other distribution sites for essential resources. By examining
walkability, this research seeks to assess how accessible these food sources are
to people without personal vehicles, especially in flood events that may disrupt
transportation routes. Key factors like income levels, transit access,
environmental conditions, and geographic barriers will be considered in
evaluating accessibility. The project ultimately aims to reveal patterns in food
accessibility and identify specific areas where improvements may be most needed.
Insights from this study could help local organizations, community planners, and
policymakers design interventions that ensure equitable food access, especially
in underserved neighborhoods that face additional transportation or
environmental challenges.

For the final project, our research will focus on identifying the presence of
food deserts within the study area of Danvers, Beverly, Peabody, Lynn, and
Salem, Massachusetts, and examining their relationship to income levels and other socioeconomic variables. A food desert is defined as an area with limited access to affordable and nutritious
food, often due to factors like distance to the nearest grocery store, lack of
public transportation, and income disparities. By mapping the spatial
distribution of food distribution sites, particularly food pantries, and
correlating these locations with income data, we aim to determine if low-income
neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by limited access to healthy food
options. This research is crucial in understanding the broader implications of
food insecurity in the context of natural disasters, such as floods, and how
certain areas may face heightened challenges in accessing essential resources
during such events. Using available GIS tools, such as the EPA Walkability
Index, I will assess how walkability impacts access to food distribution sites
in these low-income regions. The findings will contribute to ongoing discussions
about food equity, specifically by highlighting areas where interventions may be
necessary to improve access to nutritious food for underserved populations. This
research will inform future policy decisions and emergency planning efforts
related to food accessibility.

## Data Layers

#### Walk Potential/Bike Potential: 
From MassDOT, the walking and biking potential layers use multiple different equations to create a tile layer
covering the entire state that classifies areas as high, medium, and low
potential. Created in 2022 these layers are the most updated version that
massDOT has released to the public, created using four different factors (social
equity, potential demand, crashes, and transit access). This did not require
collection - but rather compiling. This data will provide already calculated
potential information to the data model.The equation that MassDOT used is : Potential for everyday walking = (0.7 * Potential Demand + 0.2 * Transportation Access) + (1 + Social Equity))
The demand coming from Potential walking demand (Local Access Score) and Streetlight data (of all trips under 3 miles). Transportation Acces indicaates all areas within a 10 minute walk from any transit hub. Finally, Social equity takes into account: Minorities, no-vehicle households, low-income households, Limited English speaking households, people with disabilities, under 18 and over 65 along with streetlight obtained demographic data.

#### Food Distribution Centers

THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION STORE TYPES - need to edit the original layers. 

The Food Distribution was collected by the Greenbelt Organization, a local non-profit
dedicated to preserving open space and promoting community well-being. This data
was gathered through field surveys, community outreach, and collaborations with
local food distribution sites to assess both food availability and the
walkability of surrounding areas. The data includes the locations of food
pantries and other distribution sites, as well as walkability scores for each
area, which were calculated based on factors like sidewalk presence, street
connectivity, and pedestrian infrastructure. The food distribution data is
categorical, identifying whether a site is a food pantry, while the walkability
data is continuous, representing varying levels of pedestrian access across the
region. This dataset will play a crucial role in identifying potential food
deserts within the study area and evaluating how accessible these resources are
for the population, particularly in relation to income levels, flood risk, and
transportation access. By mapping these data points, this research can identify
areas where food access is limited, especially for individuals without reliable
transportation, contributing to the broader goal of understanding food equity
and accessibility during emergencies

## Methods

Need to explain: 
800m buffer
combining food distribution sites
Multiplying by 10000 the walking potential 
Spatial join to census block groups, transit sites, food distribution locations
Random forest analysis of census block groups
Statistical analysis of transit sites
Statistical analysis of food distribution locations

TBD: Join food distribution locations to census block groups to identify potential food deserts? Could use cluster analysis here

## Results

Walkability is calculated using three key factors: demand, transportation access, and social equity. Demand is measured using Local Access Scores for trips under 2.5 miles, supplemented by Streetlight data for all trips under 3 miles. Transportation access prioritizes areas within a 10-minute walk of transit hubs, while social equity focuses on disadvantaged groups, including minorities, low-income households, non-English-speaking households, people with disabilities, and others. This equation integrates spatial equity by weighting these metrics, ensuring the results highlight accessibility for vulnerable populations. Understanding these metrics is key to recognizing the data shown throughout this project. 

Regarding walkability by food site type, food pantries and supermarkets exhibit the highest walkability scores, reflecting better urban integration and accessibility. Farmers’ markets form clusters with high walkability, largely due to their central urban locations. In contrast, farm stands and convenience stores demonstrate the lowest walkability, revealing significant gaps in accessibility for rural and suburban areas. This variability underscores the need for urban planning and policy efforts to target underperforming site types, particularly in less accessible regions, to enhance food equity.

The analysis reveals significant relationships between demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors and walking potential for food distribution sites in Essex County. 

*** THESE R2 are VERY low - on their own none of them are a strong relationship

Scatter plots and maps demonstrate that walking potential positively correlates with limited English proficiency (R² = 0.264), Hispanic population percentage (R² = 0.244), and the percentage of households with one vehicle or less (R² = 0.228), while a negative correlation exists with the white population percentage (R² = 0.248). Population density also shows a moderate positive correlation with walking potential (R² = 0.321). 

Maps of individual variables highlight disparities, with areas of high walking potential often aligning with high Hispanic population percentages, limited English proficiency, and low vehicle ownership, while predominantly white areas tend to have lower walking potential. Accessibility maps of 800m buffers around food sites reveal that food pantries and farmers markets are generally better integrated into walkable areas compared to grocery stores and farm stands. Linear regression analysis reinforces these findings, confirming that car ownership, population density and percent english limited households all positively influence walking potential. These results emphasize the need for equitable urban planning and targeted interventions to enhance walkability and accessibility, particularly in underserved communities.

***NOTE THAT PER WHITE and PER HISP were NOT significant 

Sam's - 

A close up of all mapping can be seen within project - separated into the three towns that have commuter rail stations - Beverly, Lynn, and Salem. Walkability was analyzed by calculating the average walkability within 800m of each station. There is only one commuter rail line that runs through the study area and that is the Newburyport/Rockport MBTA commuter rail line. The most walkable MBTA site that was observed in this analysis is the Lynn Interim Station and the least walkable is Beverly Farms.  

There are 22 food sites within 800m of the Lynn station and none within 800m of the Beverly Farms station, this in and of itself is telling and leads to the question of whether all stations with low walkability also have a low number of food sites. In Pearson's product-moment correlation the p-value indicate a statistically significant model - meaning there is enough evidence that a relationship between number of food sites and average walkability surrounding MBTA stations does exist. The correlation coefficient being 0.81 means that there is a strong positive relationship between number of food sites and the walkability around stations. In an effort to explain this the map showing transit user census data in relation to the three commuter rail towns was created. This shows a visual increase of ridership closer to commuter rail stations. 

Lo's - 

The overall walkability of an area changes greatly depending on the resolution and focus of an analysis as shown by the boxplots and choropleth maps, though the sample sizes and distribution between food access site types are not large enough for statistical comparison between locations, nor between type of food sites. When examining the walkability of towns at the road level with all 5 towns together, there's some walkability outside of downtown areas, though high walkability is concentrated in downtown Lynn and Salem as can be seen on the categorized walkability map. Histograms of walkability showed differences in the overall distribution, especially in Danvers and Peabody - both areas lacking public transportation and high walkability food access sites according to other maps in the analysis. Upon doing case studies of each individual town, walkability is higher along major roads and in downtown areas, and lowest the farther from a downtown one gets. While the majority of food access sites are in walkable areas in Lynn and Salem, Beverly, Danvers and Peabody show more variable walkability with their food access sites. In regards to the walkability around food pantries, the overall distribution of food pantries in Danvers and Peabody show low walkability, requiring individuals in these areas to have access to vehicles, an important detail discussed by my research partners Jeremy and Sam.
